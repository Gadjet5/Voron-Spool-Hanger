# Voron Spool Hanger V1 (subject to change)
 Filament Dryer/Internal Spool Holder 

This was designed to dry a single roll of filament while printing. Whilst printing ABS/ASA with a heated bed of 110 and a Nevermore filter running internal humidity is around 10% so perfect conditions for drying filament. 

Naturally Z height is affected by about 100mm and it would be pertinent to set these values in your slicer so to avoid accidental crashes.

Theoretically one could also print directly from the hanging spool but at this stage it is untested.

BOM:
 2 x M4 threaded insert
 2 x M40-SH Screws @ 10/12mm (depending on top cover thickness)
